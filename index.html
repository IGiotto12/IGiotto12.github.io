    <p class="textbox">Hello! I am Jiaqi Wu, a Math-Computer Science first-year undergraduate 
      at UC San Diego. I have plenty of hobbies so I may plan to double major 
      in Cog-Sci specializing in Design and Interaction. 
      Currently, I am looking for an internship in SWE, data analysis, or UI/UX 
      this summer 2024. Hopefully this website will prosper as I develop more skills! 
      As Apple Vision Pro been exposed to the public, many youtubers shot 
      their experience on wearing the deivce for days. I am curious about 
      how can we acheive an augmented reality and extended reality through 
      building softwares.
      
      Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human activity.
